### Migrazensus plots for Correlaid TidyTuesday 

As I explored the Migrazensus data, as part of August's Correlaid TidyTuesday event, I put together three visualisations showing: 

1. How many people with a "migration background"" live in each German region, and the proportion of these people who are eligible to vote;

2. How the votes of people with a "migration background" translate into seats in the Bundestag;

3. And, where political parties could gain district seats by winning the votes of more people with a "migration background".

[Here is the repo with my R code, graphic design files and a QGIS project](https://github.com/tbk03/tidy_tuesday_correlaid), basically everything I used while exploring the data and producing the visualisations. Sorry the repo is a bit of mess, but I hope it gives some insights into the exploratory processes I apply when visualizing data. It would be a bit misleading if I posted some polished R code, when I tend to use ggplot2 to produce the basis of visualisations before exporting these into graphic design software (Affinity Designer/Publisher at the moment).
